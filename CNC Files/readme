CNC file explination: 

These files were created using Vectric's Aspire. DXF and SVG files are also included.

Milling / routing for the G10 was done using a 1/16 carbide "grout removal" bit from Dremel. 
The aluminum arms were routed using a 1/8" straight bit.

I found that the motor mounts should be doubled up - only one allows too much flex.

Motor Mount Lower was later added to fruther reduce the flex of the motor mounts and to brace the lower part of the aluminum arm.
