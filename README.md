Folding Drone

These are 3D printed parts for the folding drone project on mkcastor.com

File 1: M3 Standoff.stl
These are 5/8" tall standoffs for M3 screws (though they may work with 4-40.) 
Depending on your printer you may need to bore them out with a 1/8" drill bit. 
Print with skirt for stability. 

File 2: Quad Legs.stl
These are skid type legs for the folding quadcopter. 
These will be subject to good bit of lateral load so print with 3 or 4 perimeters.
I used 25% infill and they are still holding up after many hard landings.
